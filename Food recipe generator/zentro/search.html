Reserve about 1 cup of the pasta cooking water before draining.\n Prepare the sauce:While the pasta is cooking, whisk the eggs and grated cheese together in a bowl until well combined. Set aside. Cook the pancetta (or guanciale): Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Add the diced pancetta (or guanciale) and cook until it becomes crispy and golden brown, about 5-7 minutes. If using garlic, add the whole cloves to the skillet with the pancetta and cook until fragrant, then remove the garlic. Combine the pasta and pancetta: Once the pasta is cooked, add it directly to the skillet with the pancetta. Toss to combine, making sure the pasta is coated in the pancetta fat. Remove from heat. Finish the dish: Pour the egg and cheese mixture over the hot pasta, tossing quickly to coat the spaghetti. The heat from the pasta will gently cook the eggs, forming a creamy sauce. If the sauce is too thick, add a little of the reserved pasta water, a tablespoon at a time, until you reach your desired consistency. Season and serve: Season with freshly ground black pepper to taste. You can garnish with more grated cheese and some fresh parsley if desired. Serve immediately and enjoy your delicious spaghetti carbonara! Notes: Make sure the heat is off when you add the egg mixture, or the eggs might scramble instead of creating a smooth sauce. Traditional carbonara does not use cream; the creaminess comes from the emulsification of eggs, cheese, and pasta water.",

Cook the Lasagna Noodles: While the sauce simmers, cook the lasagna noodles in a large pot of salted boiling water according to the package instructions, typically 8-10 minutes. Drain the noodles and lay them flat on a baking sheet or clean towel to prevent sticking. 4. Assemble the Lasagna: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).

Finish with a final layer of noodles, a little meat sauce, and the remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese on top. 5. Bake: Cover the lasagna with aluminum foil (to prevent the cheese from burning) and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes, or until the cheese is bubbly and golden brown on top. Let the lasagna cool for about 10 minutes before slicing and serving.",
